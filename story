Ages ago, deep within the enchanting forests of mistwood a gregarious programmer wanted to tell a story about a brilliant detective solving complex mysteries, Ava Mitchell. The skilled Ava had to solve a complex case. This task was called 'isValid'. The main purpose of this task was the quest of a logical value. she was given a magic book called that would help her complete this task. The tools she needed in order to begin included a word delimited by quotes called s. Within this task the resilient Ava set 'stack' equal to : This was an empty mutable ordered object. The chivalrous Ava set 'parenthesis' equal to : The collection of knowledge had to contain following key and value pairs: <key> ")" <value> "(" <key> "]" <value> "[" <key> "}" <value> "{" All of a sudden, she found herself in a situation where she had to compute something repeatedly. Like a caring mother who checks each egg again and again in the package in order to crack them traversed each element defined as 'char' over 's' theltruistic Ava checked whether 'char' was contained in "({[", in this case she performed the trick 'append' on stack. But 'append' needed extra properties to work. So she dropped in 'char' the wise Ava checked whether 'char' was contained in ")}]", in this case or the selfless Ava checked whether was not equal to the element with index char from 'parenthesis', in this case Here she returned with the logical value 'False' she performed the trick 'pop' on stack. At the end of her task, Ava Mitchell returned triumphant and victorious with a logical value, whose value (either True of False) derived by the truth of the following statement: the length of stack was equal to 0 ''
